## Introduction

The Drone Quadcopter is designed for enthusiasts and developers who want to dive into the world of drones. Whether you are looking to learn about flight control systems or simply want to enjoy flying a drone, this project offers a comprehensive solution. The code is written in C++ and is compatible with the Arduino platform, making it accessible for many users.

## Features

- **Attitude Stabilization**: Keep the drone stable in the air with advanced algorithms.
- **Altitude Hold**: Maintain a steady altitude for better control.
- **RC Control**: Use a remote control to navigate the drone.
- **Telemetry**: Receive real-time data about the drone's status.
- **Safety Features**: Built-in mechanisms to ensure safe operation.
- **Open Source**: Modify and enhance the code as needed.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Drone Quadcopter, you will need some basic hardware components and software tools. Below is a list of what you will need:

### Hardware Requirements

- **Arduino Mega 2560**: The main controller for the drone.
- **Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs)**: Control the speed of the motors.
- **Brushless Motors**: Provide the thrust needed for flight.
- **Propellers**: Generate lift.
- **Battery**: Power the drone.
- **Receiver and Transmitter**: For remote control.
- **Sensors**: Such as gyroscopes and accelerometers for stabilization.

### Software Requirements

- **Arduino IDE**: To upload the code to the Arduino Mega.
- **Libraries**: Various libraries for handling sensors and communication.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ghostboyrohit/Drone-Quadcopter.git
   ```

2. **Install Arduino IDE**: Download and install the Arduino IDE from the [official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

3. **Install Required Libraries**: Open the Arduino IDE and install the necessary libraries. You can find them in the `libraries` folder of this repository.

4. **Upload the Code**: Open the main code file in the Arduino IDE and upload it to your Arduino Mega 2560.
